## README_ASSIGNMENT_2### General info+ Sergio Delúquez for the formal language's course 0127+ compiled on a browser using OnlinegGDB's website on a mac (MacOS Tahoe 26.0.1), Python 3.x## Runpython3 main.py+ Designed to get the input specified on the file, that is:- Number of cases- Number of nonterminals (NTs)- The cases on standard CFG notationafter the input, should recieve the output of the non-left-recursive version of the NTs## How it works1. Identify left-recursive rules: These are rules where a nonterminal A appears as the first symbol (e.g., A -> A b).2. Transform the grammar:For each nonterminal A, separate the rules into recursive (e.g., A -> A b) and non-recursive (e.g., A -> c).3. Introduce a new nonterminal A' to handle the recursion:A -> c A' (non-recursive)A' -> b A' | e (recursive, with e for termination).4. Update the grammar: Replace the left-recursive rules with these new non-recursive forms.
